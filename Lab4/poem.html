                Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database
                has gone away. Oh, I believe in yesterday.

                Suddenly, There’s not half the files there used to be, And
                there’s a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so 
                suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say
            </p>

                Now all my data’s gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

                Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data
                was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday
